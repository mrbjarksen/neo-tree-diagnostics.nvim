## Installation

Installing this plugin should be possible using your package manager of choice,
assuming neo-tree.nvim has been installed.
The following uses [packer.nvim](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim):

```lua
use {
  "mrbjarksen/neo-tree-diagnostics.nvim",
  requires = "nvim-neo-tree/neo-tree.nvim",
  module = "neo-tree.sources.diagnostics", -- if wanting to lazyload
}
```

## Configuration

Configuration is done within the neo-tree config:

```lua
require("neo-tree").setup({
  sources = {
    "filesystem",
    "buffers",
    "git_status",
    "diagnostics",
    -- ...and any additional source
  },
  -- These are the defaults
  diagnostics = {
    autopreview = false, -- Whether to automatically enable preview mode
    autopreview_config = {}, -- Config table to pass to autopreview (for example `{ use_float = true }`)
    autopreview_event = "neo_tree_buffer_enter", -- The event to enable autopreview upon (for example `"neo_tree_window_after_open"`)
    bind_to_cwd = true,
    diag_sort_function = "severity", -- "severity" means diagnostic items are sorted by severity in addition to their positions.
                                     -- "position" means diagnostic items are sorted strictly by their positions.
                                     -- May also be a function.
    follow_behavior = { -- Behavior when `follow_current_file` is true
      always_focus_file = false, -- Focus the followed file, even when focus is currently on a diagnostic item belonging to that file.
      expand_followed = true, -- Ensure the node of the followed file is expanded
      collapse_others = true, -- Ensure other nodes are collapsed
    },
    follow_current_file = true,
    group_dirs_and_files = true, -- when true, empty folders and files will be grouped together
    group_empty_dirs = true, -- when true, empty directories will be grouped together
    show_unloaded = true, -- show diagnostics from unloaded buffers
  },
})
```
